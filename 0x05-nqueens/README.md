# What is the N-Queens Problem ?
Imagine you have a chessboard. An N x N chessboard has N rows and N columns. The challenge is to place N queens on the board so that no two queens can "attack" each other.

## In chess:

Queens can attack any other piece that’s in the same row, the same column, or the same diagonal.
For the N-Queens problem, this means:

1. No two queens should be in the same row.
2. No two queens should be in the same column.
3. No two queens should be on the same diagonal.
Our goal is to find a way to place all N queens on the board so that they’re all safe from each other.
